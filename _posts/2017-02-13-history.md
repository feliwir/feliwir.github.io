# Why does it matter

Before trying to redo an complex engine like this it's important 
to understand how the engine was developed and which parts make it up.

## __W3D-Engine__

The first version of the engine is known as W3D, which stands for Westwood 3D. 
Westwood Studios was an american video game developer founded 1985. They are probably most
famous for their Command and Conquer franchise, which was very succesful back in the days.

In 1998 Westwood was acquired by Electronic Arts and the Studio known as "Westwood Pacific" would later
turn into EA Pacific, the studio who was mainly behind SAGE Engine.

The W3D Engine was based on the SurRender 3D Engine by Hybrid Graphics Ltd.
It was developed developed internally for all coming 3D titles (selection):

- Command and Conquer: Renegade
- Earth & Beyond
- Command and Conquer: Renegade 2 (cancelled)

The graphics was already pretty good (considering the 
time it was written). For example the W3D-Format (the 3D Model format) was still used in the SAGE Engine,
with some more additions.

## __SAGE-Engine__

After Westwood Studios was closed in 2003 by EA, many of the employees remained at EA at the now newly
created EA Pacific Studio. The studio added many new features to the existing W3D-Engine, which where
already used across all EA Studios. 

Some of the new introduced technologies:

- Refpack compression: The standard compression used in EA during that time
- Big archives: The archive used across all EA studios. It allowed optional refpack compression
- Flash based UI: At the early 2000s the EA Canada Studio developed a Flash-based UI toolkit. 
It was used by many EA titles, including SAGE-Engine. It was first used for the BFME series
- Compressed Animations: This did drastically reduce the size of W3D-Models and allow for more complex
animations
- Better graphics: The graphics engine was updated to DirectX 9.0c and many new effects

As you can already guess by reading this the original SAGE engine was a patchwork of many different
technologies introduced by several developers. That's probably the reason why it became unmaintable
and difficult to develop at some point. The biggest problem nowadays is that the engine makes
no use of multiple CPU cores, which results in lag even on high end machines.

The games that used the SAGE engine:

- Command and Conquer: Generals
    - Command and Conquer: Generals - Zero Hour
- The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth
- The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II
    - The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth II: The Rise of the Witch-king
- Command & Conquer 3: Tiberium Wars
    - Command & Conquer 3: Kane's Wrath
