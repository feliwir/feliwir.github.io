# Welcome on my blog! 
In this blog I will describe the progress of writing a complete engine that
is trying to mimic the exact behaviour of the SAGE (Strategy Action Game Engine) from EA. This is both for 
learning and because of my passion for the games, that were created with it. In my blog posts I'll give some
technical background of various formats that were used and present the solutions i came up with for that format.
I hope you will find that journey as exciting as I do ;)
